cd survey-app
```

<b>Step # 2</b>
Create <code>.env</code> file and copy all the environment variables from  <code>.env.example</code> file to <code>.env</code>. After that change your database configuration and then create a database called <b>quiz</b>.
  

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=quiz

### Creating default admin

  ```
php artisan db:seed --class=DatabaseSeeder
```
Now you can login into the system as administrator.

## How the application works ?

<b># Admin Panel</b>

Admin will login into the system. Admin can see the list of all the registered candidate list. Mark any candidate as  <b>approved/rejected</b>. Also admin can delete , edit, view detail of any candidate.
Admin can create new quiz with question and options and view detail of any quiz. Admin has some dashboard statistics.

<b># Candidate Panel</b>
Candidate has to register first. Every candidate is registered with <code>pending</code> status. After getting registered candidate will be redirected to the login page with a success message.Note that , candidate will not be able to do anything if the status is <b>pending/rejected</b>. After getting approved by admin candidates 
can do their stuffs such as quiz participation list ( quizes he participated ), take participate any quiz test. Basically candidate can choose any quiz test to participate. After participation candidate can see the result wheather he <b>passed/failed</b>. Candidate also has some dashboard statistics as well.

<b>So, this is the way the application works. Thanks</b>
